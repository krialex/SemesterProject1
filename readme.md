# Community Science Museum

This is a project I created as part of a school assignment. The task was to create a website for a new museum that had arrived in my city. The goal was to make it an interactive site with the target group beeing children and young people, inspiring them to visit the museum.

## Description

This was a task that instructed me to create a website for the museum that should be interactive and intuitive. I chose to incorporate some small animations with a hover effect to appeal to a younger audience, but also to highlight where the user was on the page and where they could click. The pages are filled with colors that I felt would resonate with a younger audience, but I made sure that the contrasts with the text were good enough for people with visual impairments to read the text. I selected a font for the headings from fonts.google.com that I thought suited both younger people and the name of the museum, namely the Community Science Museum. The site has six pages with information about the museum and how to contact and visit it. The features on the contact page do not work, as this was a school assignment focusing only on HTML and CSS.
